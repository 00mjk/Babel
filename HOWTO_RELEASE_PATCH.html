<H1>How To Release a Babel Patch</H1>
<P>by Tom Epperly &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tepperly@llnl.gov">epperly2@llnl.gov</A>&gt;<BR>
August 17, 2006</P>
<HR>
<P>Our process for committing to and issuing patches for a formal
Babel release is more structured than a normal commit to the main
trunk because we want to ensure that we can identify what patches
have been applied to a deployed copy of Babel.</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Normally, every commit to a release begins with an issue
	entry in Babel's <A HREF="https://www.cca-forum.org/bugs/babel/">Roundup
	issue tracking database</A>. If any entry does not exist and you
	intend to publish a patch, create a new issue on Roundup.</P>
	<LI><P>Frequently, issues are first addressed on the Babel main
	trunk svn+ssh://cca-forum.org/home/svn/babel/trunk and then back
	ported to the release branch. Other times, you will fix the issue on
	the release branch directly. Instructions for each case will be
	provided separately.
	<DL>
	<dt><strong>Back porting fix from trunk</strong></dt>
	<DD>
	<p>In cases where you're going to back port,
	svn commit the fix to the main trunk and note the revision number,
	<I>n</I>, that svn reports after
	your commit. </p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>Check out a working	copy of the release branch to
	which you will apply the patch:<BR>
	svn co
	svn+ssh://cca-forum.org/home/svn/babel/branches/release-1-0-0-branch/
	babel_1_0_0_branch</p></li>
	<li><p>cd babel_1_0_0_branch</p></li>
	<li><p>svn merge -r <I>&lt;n-1&gt;</I>:<I>&lt;n&gt;
	</I>svn+ssh://cca-forum.org/home/svn/babel/trunk<BR>Where <I>&lt;n-1&gt;</I>
	is replaced by the number<I>n-1</I>,
	and <I>&lt;n&gt;</I><I>n</I> (the
	revision number of your commit to the main trunk.</P>
	</li>
	</ol>
	</DD>
	<dt><strong>Editing the release branch</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>
	In this case, you're not going to make the fix on the trunk
	first. You will edit the release branch directly.
	<ol>
	<li><p>Check out a working copy of the release branch:<br>
        svn co
	svn+ssh://cca-forum.org/home/svn/babel/branches/release-1-0-0-branch/
	babel_1_0_0_branch</p></li>
	<li><p>cd babel_1_0_0_branch</p></li>
	<li><p>Use an editor to fix the issue.</p></li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	</dd>
	</DL>
<li>
<p>At this point you should have a working copy of the release with
<em>uncommitted</em> changes that address the issue. Now you need to
make a patch file in runtime/patches/.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use your favorite text editor to create a new file in
runtime/patches/. The filename should be 14 characters or less and end
with ".txt". Normally, it's named issue<i>x</i>.txt for something that
resolves Roundup issue <i>x</i>. For patches that don't address a
Roundup issue, give it a <em>brief</em> descriptive name.</p>
<li><p>
The first line should be a brief description of the patch (ideally
less than 46 character).
</p>
<p>The second line should be the email of the issuing person or
organization. For members of the LLNL Babel team, this should be
components@llnl.gov.</p>
</li>
<li><p>svn add --auto-props issue<i>x</i>.txt your file (use whatever
patch file name you chose).
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Perform appropriate testing for your patch.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Make the patch file. cd to the top of your release branch.<br>
svn diff > /tmp/issue<i>x</i>.txt<br>
Review this file, and then upload it into the appropriate Roundup
issue entry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add an entry about your patch on this Wiki:
<a href="https://www.cca-forum.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Babel+Patches">https://www.cca-forum.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Babel+Patches</a>
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
svn commit your changes and the patch file.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If the issue is very serious consider sending an email to babel-users@llnl.gov.
</p></li>
