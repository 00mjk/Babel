Announcement
============
  The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <components@llnl.gov> are pleased to
announce the beta release of Babel, version 0.10.2.

What's New
==========
  The following features have been added, or completed, in
this release:

  + Fixed Roundup issues: 90, 91, 92, 93, 98, 103, 104, 106,
    114, 122, 124, 126, 127, 128, 131, 133, 135
  + Add support for GCC 4.0 (based on prereleases) and gfortran
  + Enable more Fortran 90 function overloading
  + Allow developers to replace libsidl's mechanism for finding
    types in libraries with their own mechanism for MOCCA CCA.
  + Undocumented prototype of assertion mechanism
  + Reduce the number of F90 stub files generated by
    combining the _array.F90 into the normal stub file.
  + General Python binding upgrade.
  + Significantly reduce the amount of array copying that occurs
    with the Python binding.
  + Python stub classes now have an inheritance structure that
    matches the inheritance in the SIDL file.
  + Make "self" a keyword.
  

(Also refer to the CHANGES file for more details.)

What Babel Is
=============
  Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or Fortran77.


Supported Languages
===================
  Babel currently supports calling libraries written in 
C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Java, or Python from drivers written 
in either C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Python or Java.  (Python 
support also requires the Numerical Python set of extensions at 
http://numpy.sourceforge.net/ ). Fortran90 requires CHASM 1.0.1 (or
later) to be installed before Babel. Chasm 1.2.0 is required to use
the gfortran F90 compiler.


Supported Platforms
===================
Linux 
Solaris
AIX (except Python)

(More expected in next few months.)

Broken Platforms (hopefully to be resurrected)
==============================================
Cygwin


Caveat
======
  Babel is research in progress.  This is a beta release 
looking for more friendly users and now some power users.  
Babel has been used on a few real projects now, there
are still too few examples, but the documentation is 
improving.


Availability
============
  The software is available for free download at
	http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components


User Resources
==============
  Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community:

	babel-users@llnl.gov  (unmoderated discussions)
	babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)

To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <majordomo@lists.llnl.gov> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  


Contacting the Authors
======================
  If you have any questions or concerns with the installation 
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team 
at components@llnl.gov.  To report bugs or suggest feature 
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at 
https://www.cca-forum.org/bugs/babel/, or send email to 
babel-bugs@cca-forum.org.
