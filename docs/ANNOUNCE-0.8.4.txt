Announcement
============
  The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <components@llnl.gov> are pleased to
announce the beta release of Babel, version 0.8.4.

What's New
==========
  The following features have been added, or completed, in
this release:

  * configuration improvements (remove dependence on jar -u)
    (bug 404 in bugzilla)
  * add missing symbols to _fAbbrev.h files for F90 interfaces
    & abstract classes (the primary reason for this release)
    (bug 507 in bugzilla)
  * Add an F90 driver for the CCA example to test F90 backend
  * Add SIDL backend regression tests
  * Add doc comments for enumerated types 
  * Fix JNI_INCLUDE configuration problems (bug 506 in bugzilla)
  * the C++ binding for array<long> has changed to SIDL::array<int64_t>
    (bug 509 in bugzilla). NOTE THIS INTRODUCES A BACKWARD 
    INCOMPATIBILITY.
  * the C++ binding for array<int> has changed to SIDL::array<int32_t>.
    NOTE THIS INTRODUCES A BACWARD INCOMPATIBILITY.

(Also refer to the CHANGES file for more details.)

What Babel Is
=============
  Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or Fortran77.


Supported Languages
===================
  Babel currently supports calling libraries written in 
C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, or Python from drivers written 
in either C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Python or Java.  (Python 
support also requires the Numerical Python set of extensions at 
http://numpy.sourceforge.net/ )


Supported Platforms
===================
Linux 
Solaris

(More expected in next few months.)

Broken Platforms (hopefully to be resurrected)
==============================================
Cygwin


Caveat
======
  Babel is research in progress.  This is a beta release 
looking for more friendly users and now some power users.  
Babel has been used on a few real projects now, there
are still too few examples, but the documentation is 
improving.


Availability
============
  The software is available for free download at
	http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components


User Resources
==============
  Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community:

	babel-users@llnl.gov  (unmoderated discussions)
	babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)

To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <majordomo@lists.llnl.gov> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  


Contacting the Authors
======================
  If you have any questions or concerns with the installation 
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team 
at components@llnl.gov.  To report bugs or suggest feature 
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at 
http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/ .
