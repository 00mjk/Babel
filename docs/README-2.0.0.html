<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Babel is a language interoperability tool intended for use by
the high-performance scientific computing community.  Developed
by the Components project ( http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components )
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Babel supports the
Scientific Interface Definition Language (SIDL) for the language-
independent declaration of interfaces associated with scientific
software packages.</p>

<p>The Babel tool, applied to a SIDL file, results in the automatic
generation of the associated skeleton and stub source files.  The
Babel user then need only add the necessary code to the _Impl source
files to complete the provision of a language-independent interface to
the package described by the SIDL file.  The languages currently
supported by Babel are C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran
2003/2008, Java and Python.</p>

<p>The remainder of this document provides basic information about
Babel including features, outstanding issues, and future work.</p>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns with the installation
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team
at components@llnl.gov .  To report bugs or suggest feature
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at
https://www.cca-forum.org/bugs/babel/ or send email to
babel-bugs@cca-forum.org .</p>

<h2>Overview for the Impatient</h2>

<p>Once you have completed the installation process (see the INSTALL
file in this directory), you are ready to proceed with using Babel.
A complete tutorial that steps you through the process of building
the ubiquitious "Hello World!" example for a single client and server
is available at ./doc/manuals/users<em>guide/html/users</em>guide.html</p>

<p>Briefly, now that you have the Babel compiler available, you'll
need to have a sidl file defined before running the compiler.
Below is a skeleton of the command line required to build the stubs,
skeletons, Makefile fragment, and GNUmakefile.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./&lt;babel&gt;/bin/babel --makefile -s&lt;lang&gt; &lt;name&gt;.sidl

  where &lt;lang&gt; is the desired language,
        &lt;name&gt; is the name of the SIDL file, and
        &lt;babel&gt; is the installation's top directory
</code></pre>

<p>Now you'll need to add the appropriate code within the splicer
pairs in the _Impl files.  Once you've finished filling in the
implementation details, you can simply compile and link the
appropriate libraries.  Again, refer to the tutorial for more
information.</p>

<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>If you are interested in running the regression tests that
are packaged in this distribution you will need to build them
since they are excluded from the basic installation process.
As in the example in the INSTALL file, given that the Babel
distribution is in $HOME/babel, the process for building and
running the regression tests is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd $HOME/babel
$ make check
</code></pre>

<p>Various diagnostics and results (e.g., PASS, XFAIL) will be
displayed to indicate the number and status of each set of
tests.  At this time, there are three sets of tests each with
three instances (9 total) that are expected to fail (i.e., XFAIL)
These are for arrays in Python, arrays in Java, and exceptions in
Java.</p>

<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Key features, or capabilities, of the Babel toolkit
are described in this section.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SIDL Data Types
SIDL defines the following data types:</p>

<p>arrays      double        interface
bool        enum          long
char        fcomplex      opaque
class       float         string
dcomplex    int</p>

<p>All data types are currently supported in C, C++, F77, F90, F03,
Python, and Java with the additional exception of long in Python.
It is important, however, to note that the binding for enum in F77
and F90 is currently INTEGER due to Babel's dependence upon C for
its internal object representation (IOR).</p>

<p>Refer to ./regression/args for clients and/or servers in C, C++,
F77, F90, F03, Python, and Java that exploit most data types. Use of
arrays can be found in ./regression/arrays (including in Python),
enums in ./regression/enums, and strings in ./regression/strings.  A
crash course in SIDL arrays can be found in the users guide.</p></li>
<li><p>SIDL Data Passing Modes
The following data passing modes are defined:</p>

<p>in      inout      out      return</p>

<p>Note that return values in F77 and F90 are translated to out
arguments.  Refer to ./regression/args for clients and
servers in C, C++, F77, F90 and F03 that exploit these modes.</p></li>
<li><p>SIDL Exceptions
SIDL provides support for exceptions.  Clients are,
however, required to check the return values.  A set
of macros are defined in ./runtime/sidl/SIDL_Exception.h
to facilitate throwing and catching exceptions in C.
Refer to ./regression/exceptions for C, C++, F77, F90, F03, and
Python servers and C, C++, F77, F90, F03, Java, and Python clients.</p></li>
<li><p>SIDL Inheritance
SIDL supports Java-like inheritance.  Refer to
./regression/inherit for servers in C, C++, F77, F90 and F03
and clients in C, C++, F77, F90, F03, Java, and Python that
exploit these features.</p></li>
<li><p>SIDL Method Overloading
SIDL supports method overloading on the client and server
side for object-oriented languages using an exact match of
the arguments.  Languages that support method overloading
make use of the method name from the SIDL file; whereas,
those that do not support overloading rely on the optional
method name extension to build unique method names.  Refer
to ./regression/overload for examples of the specification
and use of overloaded methods in C, C++, F77, F90 and F03
servers and C, C++, F77, F90, F03, Java, and Python clients 
that exploit these features.</p></li>
<li><p>Makefile Generation
Babel generates a lot of code.  To assist the developer
in managing the code, Babel will generate fragments of
makefiles.  These files are called "babel.make" and
define standard macros that list all the relevant source
code generated in that directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Code Splicing
Although Babel generates a lot of code, some code (notably)
"impl" files, require hand editing to produce useful
libraries.  Babel preserves your previous edits in certain
files.  This is done with some special CodeSplicer directives
embedded in comments in the generated code.  All code
nested between matching CodeSplicer directives will be
preserved by the Babel compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct Access to Numerics in FORTRAN 77
"Pointers" are provided for direct access to numeric
data types (i.e., dcomplex, double, fcomplex, float,
int, and long).  There is a potential for an alignment
problem with arrays of dcomplex and double, in
particular, so check the return value of the pointer
before using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Array Element Access in FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90
Array elements are accessible via subroutine calls.  For
more information, see the users manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Strings in FORTRAN 77
When implementing a method with an inout or out
string, the size of the outgoing string is at least
512 characters long.</p></li>
<li><p>Enums in FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90
Due to Babel's dependence upon C for its internal object
representation, the binding for an enumerated type is
INTEGER.  The good news is that if your Fortran and C compilers
use the same word size for C int and Fortran INTEGER, everything
should work fine.  However, if the sizes are different, then
you may have problems with using enums.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<p>There are several aspects of the distribution that still
need work.  The outstanding issues that need to be addressed
include features as well as documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Python 'long' Data Type
Arrays of long are treated as arrays of int32_t in Python.
Outside of arrays, SIDL long is mapped to Python's indefinite
precision integer data type.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Multiple Fortran Compilers
In order to use SIDL with multiple Fortran compilers, there
currently must be a separate Babel installation for each
compiler.  You will also need different versions of the
runtime library.</p></li>
<li><p>Build Processing
A mechanism for simplifying the build process needs to be
explored, especially to facilitate user builds.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ Shared Libraries and libtool
In general, the creation of shared libraries in C++ seems to
be problematic.  It was necessary to make compiler-specific
modifications to libtool.  Consequently, this distribution
includes our modified libtool.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>The following is a list of key activities that will be
explored for incorporation into subsequent releases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expanded platform and compiler support</li>
<li>Simplified Build processing</li>
<li>Data Redistribution</li>
<li>Expanded interface contract specification and enforcement capabilities</li>
</ul>
