Announcement
============
  The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <components@llnl.gov> are pleased to
announce the beta release of Babel, version 0.8.2.

What's New
==========
  The following features have been added, or completed, in
this release:

  + Completed Phase II FORTRAN 90 support (tested with Portland Group 
    compiler on Linux)
    -> Support for derived type pointers
    -> Generate an F90 module for each array type
  + Completed considerable changes to the organization of the User's Guide
    and started appendices for acronyms, error messages, SIDL backend, and
    XML backend
  + Babel 101 documentation reflects 0.8.x command line arguments and 
    grammar
  + Added "--comment-local-only" command line option
  + Bugs 402 (jar -u) and 493 (Babel101.html) fixed (see
    http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs for more details)

Backward Compatibility Issues
=============================
  + F77 _cast method has changed to allow casting from any type to any
    allowable type in a single method call

(Also refer to the CHANGES file for more details.)


What Babel Is
=============
  Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or Fortran77.


Supported Languages
===================
  Babel currently supports calling libraries written in 
C, C++, F77, or Python from drivers written in either C, 
C++, F77, Python or Java.  (Python support also requires 
the Numerical Python set of extensions at 
http://numpy.sourceforge.net/ )


Supported Platforms
===================
Linux 
Solaris

(More expected in next few months.)

Broken Platforms (hopefully to be resurrected)
==============================================
Cygwin


Caveat
======
  Babel is research in progress.  This is a beta release 
looking for more friendly users and now some power users.  
Babel has been used on a few real projects now, there
are still too few examples, but the documentation is 
improving.


Availability
============
  The software is available for free download at
	http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components


User Resources
==============
  Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community:

	babel-users@llnl.gov  (unmoderated discussions)
	babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)

To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <majordomo@lists.llnl.gov> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  


Contacting the Authors
======================
  If you have any questions or concerns with the installation 
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team 
at components@llnl.gov.  To report bugs or suggest feature 
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at 
http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/ .
