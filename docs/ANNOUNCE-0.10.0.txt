Announcement
============
  The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <components@llnl.gov> are pleased to
announce the beta release of Babel, version 0.10.0.

What's New
==========
  The following features have been added, or completed, in
this release:

  + Super methods are now supported in all language bindings
    except Python.
  + Generic arrays are now supported.
  + r-arrays (aka rarray) are a new type of array with a simpler
    interface from C, C++, F77 and F90
  + Upgrade autoconf, automake and libtool to recent versions.
  + Add the Utah C++ backend (UCxx)
  + Improve Mac OSX build (still more work to do)
  + Add _load() and _unload() methods for each class
  + Fix Roundup issues: 62, 94, 96, & 99

(Also refer to the CHANGES file for more details.)

What Babel Is
=============
  Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or Fortran77.


Supported Languages
===================
  Babel currently supports calling libraries written in 
C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Java, or Python from drivers written 
in either C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Python or Java.  (Python 
support also requires the Numerical Python set of extensions at 
http://numpy.sourceforge.net/ ). Fortran90 requires CHASM 1.0.1
to be installed before Babel.


Supported Platforms
===================
Linux 
Solaris
AIX (except Python)

(More expected in next few months.)

Broken Platforms (hopefully to be resurrected)
==============================================
Cygwin


Caveat
======
  Babel is research in progress.  This is a beta release 
looking for more friendly users and now some power users.  
Babel has been used on a few real projects now, there
are still too few examples, but the documentation is 
improving.


Availability
============
  The software is available for free download at
	http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components


User Resources
==============
  Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community:

	babel-users@llnl.gov  (unmoderated discussions)
	babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)

To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <majordomo@lists.llnl.gov> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  


Contacting the Authors
======================
  If you have any questions or concerns with the installation 
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team 
at components@llnl.gov.  To report bugs or suggest feature 
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at 
https://www.cca-forum.org/bugs/babel/, or send email to 
babel-bugs@cca-forum.org.
