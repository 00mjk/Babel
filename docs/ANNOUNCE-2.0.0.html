<h1>Announcement</h1>

<p>The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6C;&#116;o:&#99;o&#109;&#112;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#110;t&#115;&#64;&#108;&#108;&#110;&#108;&#x2E;&#x67;&#x6F;&#x76;">&#99;o&#109;&#112;&#111;&#110;&#x65;&#110;t&#115;&#64;&#108;&#108;&#110;&#108;&#x2E;&#x67;&#x6F;&#x76;</a> are pleased to
announce Babel 2.0.0, the next major step in Babel research.</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

<p>The following features have been added, or completed, in
this release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Struct support is now tested and complete for all supported 
languages, including RMI.</p></li>
<li><p>Mutex-free reference counting for GCC 4.1.2 and higher 
on any platform</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental fastcall support. (See --fast-call option)</p></li>
<li><p>F03: Rewrote the Fortran 2003/2008 binding</p>

<ul>
<li>High performance, comparable to C/C++</li>
<li>Stubs and Skeletons are now implemented in Fortran 2003
where possible.</li>
<li>Fully compatible to ISO standard</li>
<li>No longer depending on libchasmlite for r-arrays</li>
<li>Names can be up to 64 chars</li>
<li>Requires GCC >= 4.6.1 (we are using lots of advanced features,
including type extensions and C function pointers.</li>
<li>./configure will automatically detect whether all necessary
features are supported buy the specified Fortran compiler.</li>
<li>Please see BUGS for a complete list of supported compilers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Python: Added splicer block to inherit from other python classes.</p></li>
<li><p>More testcases.</p></li>
<li><p>Babel now comes with a babel.pc (PKG_CONFIG) file for easier
detection by autotools-generated `configure' and friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Many bug fixes, including</p>

<ul>
<li>Extensive build/runtime/RMI testing with GCC, Intel, Pathscale 
and PGI compilers</li>
<li>Improved Python global interpreter lock handling</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Babel now comes with a man page: babel(1)</p></li>
<li><p>Babel 2.0 now includes an experimental version of BRAID, which is an
ongoing effort to support PGAS languages such as Chapel, UPC, and X10.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(Also refer to the CHANGES file for more details.)</p>

<h2>What Babel Is</h2>

<p>Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or FORTRAN 77.</p>

<p>Babel also addresses platform interoperability through
its support for Remote Method Invocation (RMI), an
object-oriented form of remote procedure calls (RPC).
Babel RMI gives programmers the ability to write
distributed programs with minimal change to their 
existing source.</p>

<h2>Supported Languages</h2>

<p>Babel currently supports calling libraries written in C, C++,
FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran 2003/2008, Java, or Python from
drivers written in either C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, 
Fortran 2003/2008, Python or Java.  (Python support also requires the
Numerical Python set of extensions at http://numpy.sourceforge.net/ ).</p>

<p>Babel is 100% compatible with BRAID, a related project, which will
implement support for Chapel, X10 and UPC.  (see
http://compose-hpc.sourceforge.net/ ).  An experimental version
supporting Chapel clients is included in the Babel distribution. The
relevant files including documentation are located in</p>

<pre><code>contrib/braid/README
contrib/braid/braid-0.2.2.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<h1>FAQ: Fortran 2003 finally got native C bindings, why still use Babel?</h1>

<p>By using Babel you get several advanced features, such as
object-oriented programming and virtual method calls. You can also
save time by letting Babel sort out the right type declarations for
you multi-dimensional arrays. See README for a more complete list of
features to decide whether Babel is for you.</p>

<p>We also spent a lot of time to figure out the subset of Fortran 2003
that works on <strong>all</strong> platforms/compilers. It makes it also possible
to mix Fortran and other languages like Python, Java, or Chapel. Babel
can even generate the appropriate Makefile for your platform to link
the two together.</p>

<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<ul>
<li>Linux </li>
<li>IBM BG/L</li>
<li>IBM BG/P</li>
<li>Jaguar</li>
<li>Solaris</li>
<li>AIX (except Python server)</li>
<li>Mac OS X (not fully supported)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveat</h2>

<p>Babel is research in progress.  This is a release candidate for a
production release, but it is still supported by a research effort.
Babel has been used on numerous projects now. Documentation for
the newest features may not be complete. We suggest checking our
WWW site for our recent presentations about new features.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>The software is available for free download at
        https://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/</p>

<h2>LICENSE</h2>

<p>Babel is released under the GNU Lesser General Public (LGPL) license,
which is an OSI Certified open source license. It can be freely
copied, modified, and distributed under the terms of this license.</p>

<h2>User Resources</h2>

<p>Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community:</p>

<pre><code>    babel-users@llnl.gov    (unmoderated discussions)
    babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)
</code></pre>

<p>To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <a href="&#x6D;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#97;&#x6A;&#x6F;&#114;&#100;o&#109;&#111;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#x73;&#116;&#x73;&#x2E;&#108;&#x6C;&#x6E;&#108;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;">&#109;&#97;&#x6A;&#x6F;&#114;&#100;o&#109;&#111;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#x73;&#116;&#x73;&#x2E;&#108;&#x6C;&#x6E;&#108;&#46;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;</a> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  </p>
