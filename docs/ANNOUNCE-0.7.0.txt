Announcement
============
  The members of the Components Team at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory <components@llnl.gov> are pleased to
announce the beta release of Babel, version 0.7.0.  We've
designated this as a 0.7 release due to the change in the
array API and the change in SIDL.BaseException.

************************ NOTICE ************************
In transitioning to support specification of array ordering
we have modified the SIDL DTD resulting in changes to the XML
format.  If using XML features, you'll need to regenerate your 
XML; otherwise, the parser will be unable to recognize your
old-style XML.
************************ NOTICE ************************

What's New
==========
 + new FORTRAN Interface File (.fif) documents FORTRAN stub
 + new array API (see users guide for API description)
 + new array ordering constructs in the SIDL language
 + rewrite CCA decaf example to track the emerging CCA standard
   (in particular BuilderServices and ConnectionEventServices)
 + add array ordering regression test
 + SIDL.BaseException.getStackTrace renamed to SIDL.BaseException.getTrace.
 + change C++ array dim to dimen() (to get the dimension)
 + initial code work on overloaded functions (not complete)
 + fix reference counting issue with interfaces in C++
 + Add Python calling Python regression tests

Bug's fixed (taken from http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/)
=======================================================
 234 Method ordering in SIDL file is preserved
 269 Preserve non-referenced splicer block sections
 281 configure --without-fortran to build without a F77 compiler
 305 bool array (C++ destructor) problem fixed
 328 boolean in documentation changed to bool where appropriate
 359 Fix line break in #include problem.
 365 Sun's SDK 1.4.0 compatibility
 368 Sun's SDK 1.4.0 compatibility
 380 Wrong signature for borrow in SIDL_cxx.h
 381 Better array usability (borrowing in particular)
 388 name space conflict for enums in C
 393 forward decls in C++ stubs to fix mutual include problem
 400 Fixed Python stub namespace problem
 412 generate FORTRAN 77 API (human readable)
 422 better documentation of FORTRAN array alignment problem
 423 babel errors identified with "babel:"
 424 Better Python error message
 428 Added pass in Python splicer blocks


What Babel Is
=============
  Babel is designed to address problems of language 
interoperability, particularly in scientific/engineering
applications.  At the simplest level, Babel generates glue 
code so that libraries written in one programming language 
are callable from other programming languages.  Babel
generates this glue code from an interface description
written in SIDL, our Scientific Interface Definition 
Language.  Babel supports full Object-Oriented features
and exception handling even in non-OO languages such as C
or Fortran77.


Supported Languages
===================
  Babel currently supports calling libraries written in 
C, C++, F77, or Python from drivers written in either C, 
C++, F77, Python or Java.  (Python support also requires 
the Numerical Python set of extensions at 
http://numpy.sourceforge.net)


Supported Platforms
===================
Linux 
Solaris
Cygwin

(More expected in next few months.)


Caveat
======
  Babel is research in progress.  This is a beta release 
looking for more friendly users and now some power users.  
Babel has been used on a few real projects now, there
are still too few examples, but the documentation is 
improving.


Availability
============
  The software is available for free download at
	http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components

User Resources
==============
  Two email lists have been set up for the Babel community

	babel-users@llnl.gov  (unmoderated discussions)
	babel-announce@llnl.gov (announcements only)

To subscribe to one or both of these email lists, send
email to <majordomo@lists.llnl.gov> with the text
"subscribe babel-announce", "subscribe babel-users",
or both (one per line).  

Contacting the Authors
======================
  If you have any questions or concerns with the installation 
process or usage of Babel, feel free to contact the project team 
at components@llnl.gov.  To report bugs or suggest feature 
enhancements, please submit a report in the bug database at 
http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/.
